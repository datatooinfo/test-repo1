The run_analysis.R script merges two input data sets . 
nce merged, the mean and standard deviation are extracted for variables containing the string mean or std. 

Descriptive names are used for the internal files as well as in-script documentation to help explain the process. 
Variables are labeled according to the features.txt file. 

Three output files are created for further analysis, 
the mean and standard deviation for selected variables and an average for all variables. 
projectAVE is output as a tidy data set.

Please see the Code Book for details about each variable.
